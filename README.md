# Data-Structures-UFMG
My implementations for the course in Data Structures.
## First Project
An implementation of a fictional consciousness transfer system, that uses multiple linked lists to represent an array of buffers storing users data.
More info on how to use the system can be found inside the [project's file](First Project/README.md).
## Second Project
An implementation of four different sorting algorithms(Quicksort, Merge sort, Radix sort, Heapsort) to order a given input file.
More info on how to use the system can be found inside the [project's file](Second Project/README.md).
