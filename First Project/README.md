# First Project in Data Structures
In order to run this code, follow these two steps:
1. Assert that your directory is organized according to the following structure:
```
First Project/
└── src/
    └── main.cpp
└── include/
    └── buffer.h
└── obj/
└── bin/
└── Makefile
```
2.1. Run the following in command prompt on Linux:
```
>>> mkdir bin
>>> mkdir obj
>>> make 
>>>./bin/run.out <TARGET_FILE>
>>> make clean
```
2.2. Or the following in Windows:
```
>>> make 
>>>.\bin\run.out <TARGET_FILE>

```
Where <TARGET_FILE> stands for a .txt containing the commands for the program.
